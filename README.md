# Pitch:

## Pitch is a music app where users can research new artists via their public profile info, videos on youtube and tour dates.

â€œA deep cut usually refers to non-radio singles by an artist (which tend to be often underplayed), and older songs. Usually<br>
fans who are really into the artist will know the tracks but not most casual listeners." -Nuhan B. Abid, thedailystar.net<br>
<br>
<br>
Pitch was created by music fans, for music fans. Whether you want to check out a new artist or follow one of your favorites,<br>
Pitch has compiled all the information you need in one place!

### Pitch displays an artist's music video so you can sample their sound.
 Using Googles YouTube API the developers of Pitch are able to provide a sample of the artist's online presence.<br>
 The API call searches through the API request to filter out channel and playlist search results, providing a <br>
 reliable return of a single video.

 ### Learn more about an artist by checking out their info section.
Using Music Brainz Api Pitch will dig deep into the artist's known public profile and inform the user of<br>
the artist's years active and their place of origin. Additionally, this section acts as a validation of the artist's<br>
name, being able to work around erroneous spelling and capitalization inputs from the user.<br>
The info page is also home to a notes section, where users can store custom listening notes about an artist.<br>
These notes are stored locally and are recalled when that artist's info page is populated again.

 ### Want to see a band live? Pitch collects tour dates from artists around the world. 
 Using BandsInTown API Pitch will search for any upcoming performances scheduled for the artist and display them with<br>
 venue information, location, date and links to buy tickets.

### Save your favorite bands in the app to easily access them and write down any thoughts you have.
The developers of Pitch created a search history that automatically stores a searched artist name and retrieves it<br>
the next time the user visits the history section of the app. Familiar with the artist now? Didn't like what you<br>
heard? No problem. You can remove previous artists with the click of a button.
